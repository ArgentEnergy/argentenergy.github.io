During an application security assessment of a Ruby on Rails project, I identified upload functionality that allowed users to submit text, CSV, and YAML files. The YAML option stood out due to its potential as a deserialization vulnerability.  

After several uploads, I found that the process validated file contents before uploading them to Azure blob storage. YAML files starting with ```---!ruby/object:BadValue``` triggered a fatal status, while other invalid YAML files returned an error status. This fatal status was the only indicator that the upload process might be vulnerable.
