title:  "Privilege Escalation to Moderator using Email Aliases"
date:   2022-08-04

During a recent assessment, I identified a vulnerability in a Firebase application that enabled me to create a secondary password for another user, granting access to their privileged account.

## Application Background
The application allows users to watch event sessions, engage in discussions, and interact with others. Moderators have the ability to ban users or delete messages.

## Vulnerability
The vulnerability was an IDOR that allowed me to create a second profile on a user account and log in with a new registration number (password), effectively giving the account two passwords—the victim's and one set by the attacker.

The user schema for the application is below:
```json
{
    "uid": "",
    "claims": {
        "paid": true,
        "moderator": true
    },
    "email": "original@domain.com",
    "profile": {
        "email": "original+1@domain.com",
        "registration": ""
    }
}
```

The login process relies on the user's email and the registration number attached to the user profile.

To exploit the vulnerability and create a second profile on a victim's account, the attacker would need to be logged in with an email alias of the victim's address. This requires disclosing at least two pieces of information: the user ID and email address.

## Retrieving User Information
Using the public registration link, I registered an account with my own email address. After submitting the form, I was redirected to a page displaying the account's registration number (password).

**Access to the registered email address is not required to view this registration page.**

Logging into the application and visiting the Networking page shows a list of users. By inspecting the JSON data from the server, I could retrieve the user's email address, user ID, and roles.

## Exploiting the vulnerability to become a Moderator
I used the registration link to create an account with the moderator's email address as an alias (e.g., nathan+1@domain.com). Then, I logged into the application using the registration number from the page and the alias email.

The following payload was used in the browser's JavaScript console to update the current user's profile (nathan+1@domain.com).
```javascript
User.updateProfile({"registration":":registrationNumber"})
```

In the Networking tab under the browser Developer Tools, I copied a Firestore HTTP API request as a curl command containing the update user call. By modifying the call with the original moderator's user ID (nathan@domain.com: 1bgH4...), I was able to create a new user profile with a custom registration number on their account.
```bash
curl 'https://firestore.googleapis.com/google.firestore.v1.Firestore/Write/channel?database=projects%2FredactedProjectName%2Fdatabases%2F(default)&VER=8&gsessionid=:validGSessionID&SID=:validSIDValue&RID=:rid&AID=1&zx=:value&t=1' \
-H 'authority: firestore.googleapis.com' \
-H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
-H 'origin: https://redacted.com' \ 
-H 'referer: https://redacted.com/' \ 
--data-raw
'count=1&ofs=1&req0___data__=%7B%22streamToken%22%3A%22:validStreamToken%22%2C%22writes%22%3A%5B%7B%22update%22%3A%7B%22name%22%3A%22projects%2FredactedProjectName%2Fdatabases%2F(default)%2Fdocuments%2Fusers%2F:userId%22%2C%22fields%22%3A%7B%22registration%22%3A%7B%22stringValue%22%3A%22:registrationNumber%22%7D%7D%7D%2C%22updateMask%22%3A%7B%22fieldPaths%22%3A%5B%22regist
ration%22%5D%7D%7D%5D%7D' \ 
--compressed
```

The curl command had to be copied from the browser using the Developer Tools, as the SID value in the URL had a short time-to-live (TTL) and required a new command if it expired.

Once the curl command was executed successfully, the attacker could log into the application using the moderator's email (nathan@domain.com) and the registration number set in the curl command. This granted the attacker moderator permissions, including access to the moderator's inbox and conversations with other users.
